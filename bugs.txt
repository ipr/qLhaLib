List of currently known bugs:
* extraction sometimes fails in decoding/decompression
 - some kind of initialization failure
 - possibly some offset is a little off and invalid data is loaded to initialize decoding tables
 - most likely Lha-header handling is the problem here, bug somewhere in what I've done to it..
-> fixed?
