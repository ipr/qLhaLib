Based on Unix LHa 1.14i (lha-1.14i-ac20040929),
autoconfiscated version.

See: http://lha.sourceforge.jp/
and: http://www2m.biglobe.ne.jp/~dolphin/lha/lha-unix.htm

Viewing of contents seems to work.
Also at least extraction of -lh5- compressed files seems to work (hash-match equal to original).

Prebuilt binaries available in my page: http://personal.inet.fi/koti/ipr/qlhatool/index.html
